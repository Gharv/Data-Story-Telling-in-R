skills: 1
key: 7593223698
```
`@instructions`
Create a plot of the lion population size with the year on the x-axis. Include a title, axis labels.

`@pre_exercise_code`
```{r}
lion <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gharv/Questions/master/lionCrater.csv")
rhino <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gharv/Questions/master/blackRhinoCrater.csv")
```

`@hint`


`@solution`
```{r}
plot(lion$Year, lion$Population, main="Lion Population", xlab="Year", ylab="Population")

## Question 9 part 1
```yaml

rhino <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gharv/Questions/master/blackRhinoCrater.csv")
```

`@instructions`
Create a plot of the black rhino population size with the year on the x-axis.

This time make it a line plot. Include a title, axis labels, and the make the line dark green. 

Use the parameter `lty=2` in the `plot` function to make the line dashed. You still need the parameter to make it a line graph.


`@hint`


`@solution`
```{r}
plot(rhino$Year, rhino$Population, main="Rhino Population", xlab="Year", ylab="Population", col="darkgreen", type="l", lty=2)
```

`@sct`
```{r}
test_function("plot", args = c("x","y","main","xlab","ylab","col","type","lty"))

Looking at the two plots on the right how would you describe their relationship?

`@instructions`
- Direct
- Inverse

## Question 10 part 2
```yaml
type: MultipleChoiceExercise
lang: r
xp: 100

```
What is a way in which we could put the two plots onto one page with one column and two rows?

`@instructions`
- use `par(mfrow=c(2,1))` followed by the plot functions.
- use `par(mfrow=c(1,2))` followed by the plot functions.
- use `par(mfrow=c(1,2))` after using the plot functions.
- use `par(mfrow=c(2,1))` after using the plot functions.
`@hint`

`@pre_exercise_code`

rhino <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gharv/Questions/master/blackRhinoCrater.csv")

rhino2 <- subset(rhino, rhino$Year < 1993)
```

***
```yaml
type: NormalExercise
xp: 30
key: 679165b49a
```

`@instructions`
Create two new data frames `lion2` and `rhino2` that contain the subset of years that overlap between the two datasets (like we did in the last assignment). These new datasets will be used for the next plot.


`@solution`
```{r}
lion2 <- subset(lion, lion$Year > 1979)
rhino2 <- subset(rhino, rhino$Year < 1993)
```

`@hint`
Use `subset` and the `>` and `<` operators on the `Year` columns of each data frame. 

`@sct`
```{r}
test_object("lion2")
test_object("rhino2")
success_msg("Great job!")
```
***
```yaml
type: NormalExercise
xp: 30
key: bf086dec14
```


`@instructions`
Create a line plot of the lion population sizes. On the same plot add the black rhino population sizes as points. Make the lion population line purple and the black rhino population points red. Includes a title and axis labels. You will need to set the limits of the y-axis from (0,100) otherwise the rhino points will not be visible when you add them to the plot.


`@hint`


`@solution`
```{r}
plot(lion2$Year, lion2$Population, type = "l", col = "purple", main = "Lion and Black Rhino Population", xlab = "Year", ylab = "Population", ylim = c(0,100))
points(rhino2$Year, rhino2$Population, col = "red")
```

`@sct`
```{r}
test_function("plot", args = c("x","y","main","xlab","ylab","col","type","ylim"))
test_function("points", args = c("x","y","col"))
success_msg("Great job!")
```

***
```yaml
type: NormalExercise
xp: 30
key: 1b336c48fe
```
`@instructions`
Add a legend to the top right of the plot you just made â€“ make sure next to lion you have a purple line, and next to black rhino you have a red point.

You will need to leave the `plot` and `points` above this `legend` function for it to properly work.

`@hint`


`@solution`
```{r}
plot(lion2$Year, lion2$Population, type = "l", col = "purple", main = "Lion and Black Rhino Population", xlab = "Year", ylab = "Population", ylim = c(0,100))
points(rhino2$Year, rhino2$Population, col = "red")
legend("topright", legend = c("Lion", "Black Rhino"), col = c("purple", "red"), lty = c(1,NA), pch = c(NA,1))
```

`@sct`

test_function("legend", args = c("x","legend","col","lty","pch"))
success_msg("Great job!")
